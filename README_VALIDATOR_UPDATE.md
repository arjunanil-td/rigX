# RigX Validator UI Updates

## üéØ **Complete Module Removal (Latest Update)**

### **What Was Removed**
The following validation modules have been **completely removed** from the RigX validator system:

1. **ColorSetCleaner** - Removed from module loading and validation logic
2. **ColorPerVertexCleaner** - Removed from module loading and validation logic  
3. **ControllerTag** - Removed from module loading and validation logic
4. **FreezeTransform** - Removed from module loading and validation logic
5. **GeometryHistory** - Removed from module loading and validation logic

### **How It Was Removed**
- **Module Loading**: Modified `load_validation_modules()` to filter out these modules before they're loaded
- **Validation Logic**: Removed all hardcoded validation code for these modules from `_run_simple_validation()`
- **UI Filtering**: Enhanced UI filtering to prevent any remaining references from appearing
- **Order List**: Removed these modules from the hardcoded `rig_order` list

### **Result**
- **No more error messages** like "‚ö†Ô∏è ControllerTag: Failed to clean controller tags: No object matches name: controllerTag* - Scene"
- **Modules are completely invisible** in the interface and won't appear in any validation results
- **No validation logic runs** for these modules - they're completely disabled at the source
- **Clean validation results** without any unwanted module outputs

## üîç **Previous Updates**

### **Dynamic Status Button Implementation**
- Replaced static help button with dynamic `status_btn`
- Button states: Grey (default), Green ‚úì (pass), Red ‚úó (fail), Orange ? (warning)
- Status updates automatically based on validation results

### **Smart Results Display**
- Only shows errors and warnings, not passed validations
- Filters out "No issues found" messages
- Filters out misleading warning messages that indicate clean state
- Auto-hides results section when scene is clean

### **Enhanced Module Filtering**
- Comprehensive filtering using exact names and pattern matching
- Case-insensitive search for variations
- Debug output to show what's being filtered

### **Icon Integration**
- Added `rigX_validator.png` icon to the banner
- Enhanced icon search paths in Banner class

## üöÄ **Current Status**
All requested changes have been implemented and the unwanted validation modules are **completely removed** from the system. The validator will no longer show any errors or warnings related to these modules.
